# Optical-system-database-generator-

This is my python program to hack the world of #optics. this program can generate a database of all possible lens combinations at given Effective focal length. the program takes user input of multiple variables such as focal lenght of lens one and desired effective focal length and the distance between two lenses ,etc to genearte a comprehsuive database whicn contain total magonfication of the lens and position of the final image.

Last but not least the program use resolution diffraction equation to predict the resolution of the final image of each system

there is other program to use to resort the result upoan required boundries

first i intended to extract the result as excel but sometimes the result exceeded the maximum limit for excel so i switcged to Sqlite3 data bases.

Any contributios are welcome.
